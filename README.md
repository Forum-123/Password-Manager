## Password Manager

### Purpose

A custom password manager made using Python, which aims to keep track of all the passwords that have been set for the respective account.

### Usage

1. In the terminal, use the command `python main.py` to launch the command line program.
2. An empty `passwords.txt` file in the `C:\tmp` directory will be created.
3. Initially, navigate to this file and add at least one password into this text file manually.
4. Whenever the `python main.py` command is run, the program will allow you add more passwords through the command line.
